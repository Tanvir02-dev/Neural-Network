# Neural Network Predicting Chances of Admission at UCLA 
 
Neural Network Predicting Chances of Admission at UCLA
This project implements a neural network to predict the chances of admission to UCLA based on various factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rating, statement of purpose (SOP) strength, and other academic and extracurricular metrics.

Features
Input Data: The dataset includes features such as:
GRE Scores
TOEFL Scores
University Rating
Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letter of Recommendation Strength
Undergraduate GPA
Research Experience
Preprocessing: The data is normalized and cleaned to improve model performance.
Neural Network: A feed-forward neural network is built using Python and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Performance Metrics: The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error, Accuracy, and R-squared values.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains detailed records of students applying to various graduate programs. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance.

Installation and Usage
git clone https://github.com/Tanvir02-dev/Neural-Network.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the training script
python train.py

Use the model to make predictions:
python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv

Results
The neural network achieves high accuracy in predicting admission chances, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling academic success metrics.

Future Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different architectures and parameters to improve accuracy.
Additional Features: Adding more features like extracurricular activities and awards.
Deployment: Integrating the model into a web application for real-time predictions.
